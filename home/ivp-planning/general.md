### Introduction

iVP is the multi user virtual collaboration software for effective building information modeling. Executing a project with team members from different parts of the world can be challenging and demoralizing. iVP was created to eliminate the distance factor and enhance effective project execution, result evaluation, and increased work efficiency.

### List of Features

* **Effective Planning:** iVP provides the tools you need to plan large scale projects in real time. Whether machines, furnishings, rooms, or other products, this BIM software supplies you a database of 3D models that you have previously defined making the entire planning process easy.
* **Enhanced Visualization:** iVP offers you the opportunity to execute your virtual plan using different 3D inspectors. You get to experience and evaluate your project in a virtual environment and check whether the project is precisely what you imagined. That is virtual planning made easy.
* **Easy Evaluation:** With iVP, you can evaluate the feasibility and scale of your project by getting a real-time view of every aspect of the proposed final project, making it easy to identify and fix flaws or replace various products and parts that might not be useful in the project.
* **Project Collaboration:** iVP offers you the chance to collaborate with your team and clients, discuss and make modifications to your project virtually in 3D/VR/AR, no matter the location of the team members.
* **Multi 3D -Database:** iVP offers you an unlimited database of 3D models from which to choose. Even if you wish to get more specific and plan with your 3D models, you can import them into the iVP database and start planning your project. iVP processes all possible 3D formats.

### About

iVP is a virtual planning and collaborative software designed with the focus of creating an intuitive and easy to use tool to assist architects, project managers, and planners, investors and clients to achieve the best possible outcome for their projects. It helps architectural stakeholders to collaborate and plan projects to the tiniest details, no matter their physical locations. It is true that planning large scale projects is challenging, especially when many stakeholders are involved. Communication is always a problem, and this leads to increased downtime and the inability to achieve the best results.

The iVP software solves this problem by simplifying complex tasks and providing a platform where project stakeholders can collaborate in real time with automated direct 2D/3D/VR/AR visualization. With iVP, architects, planners, clients, and investors can achieve faster planning, visualization, collaboration, and evaluation, which results in increased project efficiency and stakeholders satisfaction.
