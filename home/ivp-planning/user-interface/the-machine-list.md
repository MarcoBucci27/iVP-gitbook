# Machine List Panel

The machine list panel contains a list of all machines, objects and [virtual cameras](../advanced-tools/virtual-cameras.md) in the project and is used to organize them in a [tree structure](../the-tree-view/). Via this panel it is possible to collect objects in [folders](../the-tree-view/folders.md), to [rename ](../the-tree-view/renaming-objects-and-folders.md)objects and folders, to toggle their [visibility](../the-tree-view/visibility-of-objects-and-folders.md) or to [lock ](../the-tree-view/locked-objects-and-folders.md)them to prevent unwanted changes.
