# Graphic Settings

The graphic settings offer several options to adjust the graphic quality and different visual aspects. They can be tweaked by using the [settings panel](../user-interface/settings-panel.md).

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Laptops or tablets** should usually be used with the **General Quality "Low"** and none of the graphic options below to prevent performance issues. The **General Quality "High"** is only recommended for **high-end computers** with newer graphic cards.
{% endhint %}

## The options explained:

* _**General Quality:**_ overall graphical quality based on presets
* _**Frame Rate:**_ maximal frame rate
* _**Resolution:**_ resolution of the program window

{% hint style="info" %}
The settings panel might not scale correctly after a resolution change. You can solve this problem by closing and reopening it.
