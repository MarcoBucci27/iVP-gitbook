# Importing Databases

The 2D and 3D models used in iVP are stored in manufacturer-specific databases that can be used to alter iVPs extend.

## Importing databases step by step:

To import a database, click on **File -> Import database**. A new window will open that allows you to navigate to the folder that contains the database file.

When you have found the file, simply double click or it or select it and click **Open**.

{% hint style="info" %}
Database files can easily be identified by their **.ivp** extension.
{% endhint %}

The new database will now appear in the [Machine Database panel](../user-interface/machine-database-panel.md) and can be used to [place new machines and objects](../machines/first-steps-with-3d-object.md) in the project.
