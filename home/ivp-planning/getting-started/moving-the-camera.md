# Moving The Camera

iVPs user interface includes a [2D-panel](../user-interface/the-2d-panel.md) and a [3D-panel](../user-interface/the-3d-panel.md). In both of them, the camera perspective can be changed separately.

## Moving the camera in the 2D-panel:

To move the camera, **click and hold the middle mouse button** while hovering over the [2D-panel](../user-interface/the-2d-panel.md). Now you can **move the mouse** to move the visible area.

## Moving the camera in the 3D-panel:

While hovering over the [3D-panel](../user-interface/the-3d-panel.md), you can click and hold the **right mouse button** along specific buttons to move the camera in the corresponding direction. In detail:

| Button                                    | Function       |
| ----------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| "W" or "Up Arrow" + right mouse button    | Move forward   |
| "A" or "Left Arrow" + right mouse button  | Move left      |
| "S" or "Down Arrow" + right mouse button  | Move backwards |
| "D" or "Right Arrow" + right mouse button | Move right     |
| "Q" + right mouse button                  | Move down      |
| "E" + right mouse button                  | Move up        |

To turn the camera, **move the mouse** while holding the right mouse button.

## Focusing on objects:

To focus on a selected object, press the "F" key. It will now be centered in both the [2D-](../user-interface/the-2d-panel.md) and the [3D-panel](../user-interface/the-3d-panel.md).

{% hint style="info" %}
The focus function currently works for [objects ](../machines/)and [virtual cameras](../advanced-tools/virtual-cameras.md). It does not work with [paths](../advanced-tools/path-tool.md).
{% endhint %}
