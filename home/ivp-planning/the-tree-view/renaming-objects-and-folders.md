# Renaming Objects And Folders

In iVP, objects and folders can be renamed without limitations concerning name length or special characters like the umlauts "ä", "ü" and "ö".

{% hint style="info" %}
The name of an object is global - when it is changed in the [machine list panel](../user-interface/the-machine-list.md) it will also be changed in the [info panel](../user-interface/the-info-panel.md) and vice versa.
{% endhint %}

## Renaming objects and folders in the machine list panel:

To change the name of an object or folder [select ](../machines/selecting-and-moving-objects.md)it and press the **F2** key on your keyboard. The current name in the [machine list panel](../user-interface/the-machine-list.md) will now a blue square as background which indicates that it can be changed. Type in the new name and press **Enter**.
