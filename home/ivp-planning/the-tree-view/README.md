# The Tree View

Every object that is added to an iVP project will get an associated entry in the [machine list panel](../user-interface/the-machine-list.md) during its creation. These entries can be used to [select objects](../machines/selecting-and-moving-objects.md), but are also useful when it comes to project organization. By using [folders ](folders.md)and [custom names](renaming-objects-and-folders.md) it is possible to structure large scenarios. [Locking options](locked-objects-and-folders.md) can prevent unwanted changes while a toggleable [visibility](visibility-of-objects-and-folders.md) of objects can be used remove them from view without deleting them.
