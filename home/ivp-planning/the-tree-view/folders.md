# Folders

Folders can be used to structure projects. They can only be accessed in the [machine list panel](../user-interface/the-machine-list.md), however [locking ](locked-objects-and-folders.md)or [hiding ](visibility-of-objects-and-folders.md)them will affect all objects inside - also in the [2D- ](../user-interface/the-2d-panel.md)and [3D-panel](../user-interface/the-3d-panel.md).

## Moving objects into folders:

To move objects into a folder, select their entries in the machine list panel and drag them on the folder name. As soon as the folder is framed by a white line you can release the mouse. The elements will now be moved into their new folder.
