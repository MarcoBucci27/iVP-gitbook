# Login

When starting iVP Planning, you will have to log in with your Microsoft-Account.  
To do so, iVP will open up a web page in your browser that will guide you through the log-in process.

If - by chance - an error occurs, see if any of the following does apply:

## No Login Screen in iVP

iVP automatically opens an external browser page that guides you through the login. If no new window is opening, check if any open web browser opened a new tab. If this does however not work as intended, close your browser, restart iVP Planning and check if a web page opens up. 

## Error Message AADSTS50020


You might see this error message while logging into your Microsoft Account, stating that your currently used Microsoft-Account does not "exist in tenant 'iVP'" (and a lot of letters and numbers).

This can happen if you are trying to log in with the wrong Microsoft Account.  
To fix this, ensure you are using the correct Microsoft Account and try again.
