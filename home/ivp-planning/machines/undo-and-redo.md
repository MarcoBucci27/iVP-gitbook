# Undo And Redo

{% hint style="danger" %}
Undo/redo currently only supports positions, rotations and scales of objects. All other changes are permanent.
{% endhint %}

Use the _Ctrl+Z_ keyboard shortcut to undo changes and _Ctrl+Y_ to redo them. Alternatively, you can also use the undo/redo buttons in the toolbar of the [2D panel](../user-interface/the-2d-panel.md).
