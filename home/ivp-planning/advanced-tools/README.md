# Advanced Tools

iVP offers some more advanced tools that exceed simple place- and movement of objects. With these tools it is possible to [take screenshots](creating-screenshots.md), [record videos](virtual-cameras.md#setting-up-virtual-dolly-shots) and even to create [measurements](path-tool.md), [fences](fence-tool.md) and [rooms](the-room-tool.md) that automatically adapt to changed parameters.
