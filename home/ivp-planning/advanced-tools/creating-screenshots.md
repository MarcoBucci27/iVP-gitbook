# Creating Screenshots

At any time it is possible to save the current content of the [3D-panel](../user-interface/the-3d-panel.md) as a screenshot. To do so, first click on the "Screenshot" icon in the toolbar of the 3D-panel.

A new window will open that lets you specify the resolution of the screenshot. If the "Open" option was checked, the screenshot will be opened in the default image viewer after it has been created.

After confirmation, an explorer window will open which allows you set an output folder and output format (.jpg or .png).
