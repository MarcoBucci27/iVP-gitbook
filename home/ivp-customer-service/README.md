# iVP Customer Service

It is possible to contact the iVP developers using our customer service. There you can submit requests for new features and follow their progress.  
To use this platform, you need to sign up for the [iVP Customer Service](https://ixtenda.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/1). Every key user received a personal invitation. Please follow the link in the e-mail to complete the registration process.

> **Please notice:**  Our customer portal is currently still in development and is therefore only accessible for iVP key users. We hope to expand the range of functions and services in the future.
